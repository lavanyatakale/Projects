Credit default prediction and classification is a critical task in the financial industry, impacting both financial institutions and consumers. Accurately classifying the risk of default into categories like high, medium, low, and no risk enables informed decision-making on loan issuance, interest rates, credit limits, and additional financial services. However, this endeavor presents several challenges, including data imbalance, attribute selection, model transparency, and regulatory compliance.
Analyzing datasets containing individuals' credit records, payment histories, debt ratios, and credit utilization patterns, we employ various techniques to devise an accurate predictive model. Our approach encompasses exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and the implementation of algorithms such as logistic regression, support vector machines (SVMs), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and decision trees. By leveraging the power of machine learning and adhering to ethical principles, our credit score classification system aims to facilitate responsible lending practices, safeguard consumer interests, and contribute to a more stable and equitable financial ecosystem.
Machine learning classification models like KNN, SVM, and Logistic Regression are used to predict the Risk of defaulting by categorizing it into classes such as "No Risk," "Low Risk," “Moderate Risk”, and "High Risk”.
Data consists from a bank in Taiwan and the targets were credit card holders of the bank.  Total 30,000 observations, and 27 variables as explanatory variables: Amount of the given credit (NT dollar), Gender (1 = male; 2 = female), Education (1 = graduate school; 2 = university; 3 = high school; 4 = others), Marital status (1 = married; 2 = single; 3 = others), Age (year), History of past monthly payments, Amount of bill statement. The target variable is Risk of Default consists of 4 classes namely, High Risk, Moderate Risk, Low Risk and No Risk. 
Labeled Data Availability: The problem of credit default risk classification relies on having labeled data, where each data instance (customer record) is already assigned a known class label (e.g., high risk, low risk, no risk). Supervised learning algorithms like SVM, KNN, and logistic regression can effectively learn from this labeled data to build predictive models that can classify new, unseen instances. On the other hand, unsupervised learning techniques like k-means clustering are used when the data is unlabeled, and the goal is to discover inherent patterns or groups within the data itself.
Handling Imbalanced Data: Credit default datasets often exhibit class imbalance, where the number of instances in different risk categories (e.g., high risk, low risk) can vary significantly. Supervised learning algorithms like logistic regression and SVMs have well-established techniques (e.g., class weighting, oversampling, undersampling) to handle imbalanced data and ensure fair and accurate predictions across all classes. Unsupervised techniques like k-means clustering may struggle with imbalanced data and could potentially overlook or misrepresent minority classes.
